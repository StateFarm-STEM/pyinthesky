# Lesson #6. Storing the data

## Working with SD card using the Arduino language

#### Pre-requisites:
- you have successfully ran the blinky lights program on your Arduino
- if not, do that first

#### Objectives:
- Breadboard a circuit
- Create a file with some data on the sd card

## Measure Pressure and Temperature using the BMP180

#### What you will be using:
- [Arduino IDE](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson6/screenshots/arduino-ide.png)
- [Arduino Uno](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson6/screenshots/arduino-uno-r3.png)
- [MicroSD Card Module](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson6/screenshots/bmp180.png)
- [Breadboard](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson6/screenshots/breadboard.png)
- Wires

#### What you will be learning:
- How to connect the SD card to the Arduino using a breadboard
- How to create a new Arduino Sketch project using the SDI Library
- Write the code in the Arduino IDE and upload it to the Arduino
  - create a file on the SD card
  - write some data to the SD card
- Watch your code run on the Arduino using Arduino IDE's serial monitor
