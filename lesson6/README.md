# Welcome to Lesson #6: putting it all together

## Working to make the final data logger

#### Pre-requisites:
- it is recomended that you have successfully completed all the previous lessons 

#### Objectives:
- Breadboard the final circuit
- create a device that logs data such as humidity, altitude and tempurature onto a CSV file within a micro sd card. 


#### What you will be using:
- [Arduino IDE](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson6/screenshots/arduino-ide.png)
- [Arduino Uno](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson6/screenshots/arduino-uno-r3.png)
- [MicroSD Card Module](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson6/screenshots/bmp180.png)
- [BMP 180](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson1/photos/BMP_both.jpg)

- [GPS module](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson1/photos/GPS_NEO-6M.JPG)
- [Breadboard](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson6/screenshots/breadboard.png)
- [Wires](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson3/screenshots/1956-02.jpg)

#### What you will be learning:
- How to connect multiple different sensors or devices to the ardiuno at the same time
  -  This will involve using a breadboard to connect all the sensors back to the Ardiuno
- How to read a CSV file from the serial port

### Wiring all the sensors and devices to the Ardiuno


- Remember you do not have to use the same color of jumper wire as this, but insure that your connections are the same.
