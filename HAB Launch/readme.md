# Here are some details about the launch

## Proof of concept launch

- We launched on 3/28 aproximately 4pm at Tri-Valley High school
- [Video of launch](https://vimeo.com/693551736)

## Lessons Learned (first draft)

- We need to have a second tracker incase one fails
- The address and phone numbers if found should be written and taped over to protect from weather
- The address and phone numbers should be in the payload in a ziploc
- Testing should be done exactly as the tracker will fly
  - perhaps even from a smaller balloon or drone etc
- Fix the scale issue we saw. Perhaps double checking with a jug of water / sand to the specified lift
  - lift should be 1.5 times the full payload (everythign under the balloon). I included the   
- The payload train should be laid out so the balloon picks it up as it travels with the wind (the train should point the same direction as the wind)
- Review what each user will do at launch before hand ensuring questions are answered ahead of time
- Setup more cameras to catch more angles
  - Mix up some with time lapse
- Use rigging lines for the payloads
- Use premade lines for attaching to the fill tank and lines to the scale to calculate the lift
- Use PVC coupler for mounting point. Zip Tie int h neck before filling attaching rigging loops


## Things we need to plan for

- Location of the launch
  - Plan for a spot for each wind condition
  - Clear of obstructions for both a good launch and one that may not go as planned
  - School map [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.3948635,-89.2446226,1043m/data=!3m1!1e3)
- Weather
  - Preferably <10mph winds
  - Medium or no cloud cover
  - No rain for launch and ideally landing
- Run predictions
  - Launch coordinates 40.3948635 -89.2446226
