# Welcome to lesson 4

## Working with weather sensor data using the Arduino language

#### Objectives:
- Breadboard a circuit
- Read weather sensor data
- Print the weather sensor data to the serial port

## Measure Pressure and Temperature using the BMP180

#### What you will be using
- Arduino IDE
- Arduino Uno
- BMP180 Sensor
- 5 pin connector
- Breadboard
- Wires

#### Note: the BMP180 Sensor didn't detect the pressure and temp accurately until I soldered the 5 pin connector to the BMP180<br>
