# Welcome to lesson 4

## working with weather sensor data using Python

### Objectives:
- Successfully breadboard a circuit
- Read weather sensor data using Python

### What you will be using
- Arduino Uno
- BMP180 Sensor to measure temperature and pressure
- 5 pin connector
- Note: the BMP 180 didn't work for me until I soldered the 5 pin connector to the BMP180
- Breadboard
- Wires

#### Measure Pressure and Temperature using the BMP180
- Follow along this lesson to read the weather data from the DMP180 sensor
