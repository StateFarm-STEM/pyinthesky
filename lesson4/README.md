# Welcome to lesson 4

## Working with weather sensor data using the Arduino language

#### Pre-requisites:
- you have successfully ran the blinky lights program on your Arduino
- if not, do that first

#### Objectives:
- Breadboard a circuit
- Read weather sensor data
- Print the weather sensor data to the serial port

## Measure Pressure and Temperature using the BMP180

#### What you will be using:
- [Arduino IDE](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson4/screenshots/arduino-ide.png)
- [Arduino Uno](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson4/screenshots/arduino-uno-r3.png)
- [BMP180 Sensor](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson4/screenshots/bmp180.png)
- [5 pin connector](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson4/screenshots/5-pin-connector.png)
- [Breadboard](https://github.com/StateFarm-STEM/pyinthesky/blob/main/lesson4/screenshots/breadboard.png)
- Wires

#### Note: the BMP180 Sensor didn't detect the pressure and temp accurately until I soldered the 5 pin connector to the BMP180<br>

#### What you will be learning:
- How to connect the BMP180 to the Arduino using a breadboard
- How to create a new Arduino Sketch project using the Adafruit BMP085 Library
- Write the code in the Arduino IDE and upload it to the Arduino
  - measure the temperature in celcius from the BMP180 and convert to fahrenheit
  - read the pressure in pascals and convert to inches of mercury
  - print your calculations to the Arduino's serial port
- Watch your code run on the Arduino using Arduino IDE's serial monitor
