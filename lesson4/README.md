# Welcome to lesson 4

## working with weather sensor data using Python

### Objectives:
- Breadboard a circuit
- Read weather sensor data using Python
- Print the data to the serial port

### What you will be using
- Arduino Uno
- BMP180 Sensor
- 5 pin connector
- Breadboard
- Wires
<br>
####Note: the BMP180 Sensor didn't detect the pressure and temp accurately until I soldered the 5 pin connector to the BMP180<br>

### Measure Pressure and Temperature using the BMP180
<br>
Follow along this lesson to read the weather data from the DMP180 Sensor
