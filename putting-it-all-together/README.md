## Putting it all together - still in progress

You will now take everything you learned and apply them all into a single project that will take those measurements and GPS coordindates writing that information out to the Micro SD card using a data format called CSV (comma separated values).



#### Let's recap what you learned up to this point...

### Lesson 1

### key points
- you learned you will be writing code that will run on an Arduino that will fly to the stratosphere while taking measurements and gps coordinates along the way
- you learned you will save these individual measurements and coordinates in a file on the Micro SD card
- you learned this done every day across the US for modeling weather and predicting forecasts

### Lesson 2

#### key points
- you learned how to download, install, and create your first working Arduino Sketch
- you learned how to connect your Arduino Uno to your computer
- you learned how to turn on an off the light on the Arduino Uno
- you learned how to make your code sleep briefly between turning the light on and off

### Lesson 3 - we skippedthis lesson

### Lesson 4

#### key points
- you learned how to use a bread board with your Arduino and the BMP180 sensor
- you learned how to import a library needed to talk to the BMP180
- you learned how to connect to the BMP sensor using a variable and take measurements
- you learned how to use variables to hold the individual measurements and write them out to the serial port
- you learned how to view the measurements as your code ran on the Arduino using the Serial Port Monitor

### Lesson 5

#### key points
- you pretty much repeated the same things you learned in Lesson 4 as to how to connect to a module or sensor
- one exception is that you learned you needed a different library for the GPS module
- the other exception is that the code looked different, but similar too

### Lesson 6

#### key points
- you pretty much repeated the same things you learned in Lesson 4 and 5 as to how to connect to a module or sensor
- one exception is that you learned you needed a different library for the Micro SD card module
- the other exception is that you created a file on the card and wrote some data to the file
