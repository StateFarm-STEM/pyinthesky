## Py in The Sky - Python High Altitude Balloon Data Tracker

### This is a STEM project meant to teach the following:

- Microcontroller / electronics basics
- Introduction to coding concepts
  - Python being the language of choice
- Test the finished product in a high altitude balloon flight to the stratosphere (90-125k feet)

Lessons will be broken up into short lessons students can work on by themselves or in small groups.
